# obdii-reader
This is an OBD-II diagnostic system for cars. It reads diagnostic information from a car's OBDII port. It is based on the ATmega32 microcontroller.

For more details about this project, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/arashn/obdii-reader/wiki).

This system does not work with vehicles manufactured prior to 1996, as most pre-1996 vehicles do not have the OBD-II system. Additionally, at the moment, this system only works with vehicles that support the ISO 9141-2 protocol. To determine whether your car supports the ISO 9141-2 protocol, refer to [this webpage](http://www.obdii.com/connector.html).

You can contribute to this project by helping add support for other protocols, and finding bugs.
